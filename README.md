# auto-mealpal-order
######Quick and dirty script to order from MealPal

Two minute script I wrote using CasperJS on top of PhantomJS to throw on a Cron job to automatically order me food on MealPal
because I tend to forget. Shit code right now, will eventually refactor to make more obsolete-proof, toss in some jQuery God forbid

Do an npm install then run casperjs script.js
You will need to download and install PhantomJS beforehand from here: http://phantomjs.org/download.html

Their frontend is built on AngularJS and Bootstrap (3.x)
